## Running the tests

The tests run on [Testem](https://github.com/airportyh/testem). Full documentation can be found there.

For our test purposes, we will be running testem on Chrome.

* Open a new Chrome window to the url provided in the terminal

Note: The tests will run much faster if you open a new Chrome window, not a new chrome tab.
